## Overview

AISiteBuilder includes built-in hosting powered by a global CDN. Your websites are automatically deployed and served from edge locations worldwide.

## Deployment

### Automatic deployment

Your website is automatically deployed when you:

- Click **Publish** in the editor
- Enable auto-deploy in settings
- Push changes via Git integration

### Manual deployment

Control when your website goes live:

1. Make changes in the editor
2. Test in preview mode
3. Click **Publish** when ready
4. Website deploys in seconds

### Deployment process

When you deploy:

1. Code is built and optimized
2. Assets are compressed and cached
3. Website is distributed to CDN
4. SSL certificate is verified
5. Website goes live

<Tip>
  Deployments typically complete in 10-30 seconds.

- **Environment variables** - Build-time variables
- **Node version** - Specify Node.js version

### Preview deployments

Test changes before going live:

- **Preview URLs** - Unique URL for each change
- **Branch previews** - Deploy from different branches
- **Pull request previews** - Test PRs before merging

## Monitoring

### Deployment history

Track all deployments:

- View deployment log
- See what changed
- Rollback to previous deployment
- Download deployment artifacts

### Analytics

Monitor your website:

- **Traffic** - Page views and visitors
- **Performance** - Load times and Core Web Vitals
- **Errors** - Track and debug errors
- **Uptime** - Monitor availability

### Logs

Access deployment and runtime logs:

- Build logs
- Error logs
- Access logs
- Custom logs

## Rollback

### Quick rollback

Revert to a previous deployment:

1. Go to **Project Settings → Hosting**
2. View **Deployment History**
3. Click **Rollback** on previous deployment
4. Confirm rollback

Previous version goes live immediately.

### Selective rollback

Rollback specific changes:

1. View deployment diff
2. Select changes to revert
3. Create new deployment with reverted changes

## Custom hosting

### Export your website

Download your website files:

1. Go to **Project Settings → Hosting**
2. Click **Export Project**
3. Download ZIP file
4. Host anywhere you want

### Git integration

Deploy via Git:

1. Connect GitHub repository
2. Push changes to repository
3. Automatic deployment triggered
4. Website updates automatically

### External hosting

Deploy to external platforms:

- **Netlify** - Connect Netlify account
- **Vercel** - Deploy to Vercel
- **AWS** - Export and deploy to AWS
- **Custom server** - Download and self-host

## Performance optimization

### Caching strategy

Optimize caching for better performance:

```javascript
// Static assets - cache for 1 year
/assets/* → Cache-Control: max-age=31536000

// HTML pages - cache for 1 hour
/*.html → Cache-Control: max-age=3600

// API responses - no cache
/api/* → Cache-Control: no-cache
```

### Image optimization

Images are automatically optimized:

- **Format conversion** - WebP for supported browsers
- **Responsive images** - Multiple sizes generated
- **Lazy loading** - Load images as needed
- **Compression** - Reduced file sizes

### Code splitting

JavaScript is automatically split:

- **Route-based splitting** - Load code per page
- **Component splitting** - Load components on demand
- **Vendor splitting** - Separate third-party code
