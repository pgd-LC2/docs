## Editor overview

The AISiteBuilder editor provides a powerful yet intuitive interface for building and customizing your websites.

## Main interface

### Chat panel

The chat panel is your primary way to interact with AI:

- **Describe changes** you want to make
- **Ask questions** about your website
- **Request features** to add
- **Get suggestions** for improvements

<Tip>
  Be specific in your requests. Instead of "make it better," try "increase the font size of the heading and add more spacing between sections."
</Tip>

### Preview panel

The preview panel shows your website in real-time:

- **Live updates** as AI makes changes
- **Interactive preview** - click and navigate your site
- **Device switching** - test desktop, tablet, and mobile views
- **Responsive design** testing

### Code view

Access the underlying code of your website:

- **View all files** in your project
- **Edit code directly** if you prefer
- **Understand structure** of your website
- **Copy code** for external use

## Building modes

### Build mode

Standard mode for creating and modifying your website:

1. Describe what you want
2. AI generates the code
3. Preview updates in real-time
4. Iterate until satisfied

### Plan mode

Plan your website before building:

1. Describe your complete website vision
2. AI creates a detailed plan

<Note>
  Plan mode is recommended for complex websites. It helps ensure AI understands your complete vision before writing code.
