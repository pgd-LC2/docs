## Understanding tokens

Tokens are the currency of AI interactions. Each message you send and each response from AI consumes tokens.

### What uses tokens

- **Your prompts** - Messages you send to AI
- **AI responses** - Code and text AI generates
- **Context** - Previous conversation history
- **Code edits** - Modifications to existing code

### What doesn't use tokens

- **Preview** - Viewing your website
- **Discussion mode** - Brainstorming without building
- **Settings changes** - Configuring your project
- **File browsing** - Viewing project files

## Token-saving strategies

### Use plan mode

Plan mode helps you refine requirements before building:

1. Describe your complete vision
2. AI creates a detailed plan
3. Review and adjust the plan
4. Build only when plan is perfect

This prevents costly rebuilds from misunderstood requirements.

### Use discussion mode

Brainstorm and clarify ideas without using tokens:

```text
[In discussion mode]
I'm thinking about adding a blog to my website. 
What sections should I include? What's the best 
way to organize posts?
```

Once you've decided, switch to build mode with clear requirements.

### Be specific upfront

Vague prompts lead to back-and-forth corrections:

❌ **Wasteful:**
```text
You: "Add a contact form"
AI: [creates basic form]
You: "Add phone number field"
AI: [adds field]
You: "Add validation"
AI: [adds validation]
You: "Make it two columns"
AI: [restructures form]
```

✅ **Efficient:**
```text
You: "Add a contact form with name, email, phone, and 
message fields. Use two-column layout. Include validation 
for all fields. Show error messages below each field."
AI: [creates complete form correctly]
```

### Batch related changes

Group similar changes together:

❌ **Wasteful:**
```text
"Change the button color to blue"
"Make the button larger"
"Add rounded corners to the button"
"Add a shadow to the button"
```

✅ **Efficient:**
```text
"Update the button: blue background, larger size, 
rounded corners, and subtle shadow"
```

### Use the visual editor

For simple changes, use the visual editor instead of AI:

- Text edits
- Color changes
- Image swaps
- Spacing adjustments

Save tokens for complex changes that require code.

### Provide complete information

Include all necessary details in one prompt:

```text
Create a pricing section with:
- Three tiers: Basic ($9/mo), Pro ($29/mo), Enterprise (custom)
- Features list for each tier
- "Most popular" badge on Pro tier
- Annual/monthly toggle
- CTA button on each tier
- Responsive design (stack on mobile)
```

### Reference existing elements

Build on what exists:

```text
"Create a testimonials section using the same card 
style as the features section"
```

This is clearer and more efficient than describing the style from scratch.

## Efficient workflows

### Start with structure

Build the skeleton first, then add details:

1. **Structure:** "Create a landing page with header, hero, features, testimonials, pricing, and footer"
2. **Content:** "Add this content to the hero section: [content]"
3. **Styling:** "Update the color scheme to use blue and green"
4. **Polish:** "Add animations and hover effects"

### Use templates

Start with a template for common patterns:

```text
"Create a standard SaaS landing page template"
```

Then customize:

```text
"Update the hero headline to: [your headline]"
"Change the features to: [your features]"
```

### Iterate strategically

Make changes in logical order:

1. Get the layout right
2. Add content
3. Refine styling
4. Add interactions
5. Polish details

Don't jump around randomly—each iteration should build on the previous.

### Save successful prompts

Keep a document of prompts that worked well:

```text
Pricing section prompt:
"Create a pricing section with three tiers in a row. 
Each tier should have: name, price, feature list, 
and CTA button. Highlight the middle tier. Use card 
design with subtle shadows."
```

Reuse these for future projects.

## Advanced techniques

### Incremental building

Build complex features in stages:

**Stage 1:** Basic functionality
```text
"Create a blog post list showing title and excerpt"
```

**Stage 2:** Add features
```text
"Add category filtering to the blog list"
```

**Stage 3:** Polish
```text
"Add pagination and search to the blog"
```

### Selective editing

Edit specific parts instead of regenerating:

```text
"In the hero section, change only the headline to: 
[new headline]. Keep everything else the same."
```

### Use code view

For developers, sometimes editing code directly is faster:

1. Generate initial code with AI
2. Make small tweaks in code view
3. Use AI only for complex changes

### Leverage context

AI remembers your conversation:

```text
"Use the same color scheme as before"
"Add that feature we discussed earlier"
"Apply the same style to this new section"
```

## Monitoring token usage

### Check your balance

Monitor tokens in your account:

- View remaining tokens
- See usage history
- Track tokens per project

### Set project budgets

Allocate tokens per project:

```text
"I have 10,000 tokens for this project. Let's plan 
carefully to stay within budget."
```

### Estimate before building

Ask AI to estimate token usage:

```text
"How many tokens will it take to build a 5-page 
website with these features: [list features]"
```

## When to use tokens freely

### Complex features

Don't skimp on tokens for complex functionality:

- Database integration
- Authentication systems
- Payment processing
- Complex interactions

These require AI's full capabilities.

### Learning

Invest tokens in learning:

```text
"Explain how this code works and suggest improvements"
```

Understanding helps you build more efficiently later.

### Critical fixes

Use tokens to fix important issues:

```text
"The checkout process is broken. Users can't complete 
purchases. Please debug and fix."
```

## Token-saving checklist

Before sending a prompt, ask:

- [ ] Is this specific enough?
- [ ] Can I batch this with other changes?
- [ ] Can I use the visual editor instead?
- [ ] Have I provided all necessary information?
- [ ] Am I using plan or discussion mode when appropriate?
- [ ] Is this the most efficient way to achieve my goal?

## Common token wastes

### Repeated corrections

❌ Making the same type of correction multiple times
✅ Provide complete requirements upfront

### Vague requests

❌ "Make it look better"
✅ "Increase heading font size to 48px, add 60px spacing between sections"

### Unnecessary regeneration

❌ Regenerating entire sections for small changes
✅ Request specific edits to existing code

### Not using discussion mode

❌ Using build mode to brainstorm ideas
✅ Use discussion mode for planning, build mode for execution

### Ignoring the visual editor

❌ Using AI for simple text changes
✅ Edit text directly in visual editor
