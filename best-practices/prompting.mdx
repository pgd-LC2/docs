## Principles of effective prompting

### Be specific

Vague requests lead to vague results. Provide clear, detailed instructions.

<CodeGroup>

```text Good
Create a hero section with:
- Headline: "Build Websites Faster"
- Subheadline: "AI-powered website builder for everyone"
- Two CTA buttons: "Get Started" (primary) and "Watch Demo" (secondary)
- Background: gradient from blue to purple
- Include a mockup image on the right side
```

```text Bad
Make a nice hero section
```

</CodeGroup>

### Provide context

Help AI understand your goals and audience.

```text
I'm building a landing page for a B2B SaaS product targeting 
small business owners. The product helps manage customer 
relationships. Create a features section highlighting:
- Easy contact management
- Automated follow-ups
- Sales pipeline tracking
Use professional, trustworthy design.
```

### Use examples

Reference existing websites or designs:

```text
Create a pricing section similar to Stripe's pricing page:
- Three tiers: Starter, Professional, Enterprise
- Monthly and annual toggle
- Feature comparison list
- Highlight the Professional tier
```

### Break down complex requests

For large projects, work in steps:

1. "Create the overall page structure with header, hero, features, and footer"
2. "Now add a testimonials section between features and footer"
3. "Add a pricing table before the footer"
4. "Finally, add a FAQ accordion at the bottom"

## Prompting patterns

### Structural prompts

Define layout and structure:

```text
Create a landing page with this structure:
1. Navigation bar (logo left, menu items right)
2. Hero section (full width, centered content)
3. Features grid (3 columns)
4. Testimonials carousel
5. CTA section
6. Footer (3 columns: company info, links, social)
```

### Design prompts

Specify visual style:

```text
Design style:
- Modern and minimal
- Primary color: #3B82F6 (blue)
- Secondary color: #10B981 (green)
- Font: Inter for headings, system font for body
- Rounded corners on buttons and cards
- Subtle shadows for depth
- Lots of white space
```

### Content prompts

Provide or request content:

```text
For the hero section, use this content:
Headline: "Ship Faster with AI"
Subheadline: "Build production-ready websites in minutes, not weeks"
CTA: "Start Building Free"

For other sections, generate appropriate placeholder content.
```

### Functional prompts

Describe behavior and interactions:

```text
Add these interactions:
- Smooth scroll to sections when clicking nav links
- Fade in animations as sections come into view
- Hover effects on buttons (scale up slightly)
- Mobile menu that slides in from the right
- Form validation with error messages
```

## Common scenarios

### Building a landing page

```text
Create a landing page for [product name], a [product description].

Target audience: [describe audience]

Sections needed:
1. Hero with headline, subheadline, CTA, and hero image
2. Problem/solution section
3. Features grid (3 features)
4. Social proof (logos or testimonials)
5. Pricing (3 tiers)
6. FAQ
7. Final CTA

Design: [modern/professional/playful/etc.]
Colors: [primary and secondary colors]
```

### Adding a feature

```text
Add a testimonials section after the features section.

Requirements:
- Show 3 testimonials in a row
- Each testimonial includes: quote, author name, author title, author photo
- Add subtle background color to distinguish from other sections
- Make it responsive (stack on mobile)

Use these testimonials:
[paste testimonial content]
```

### Fixing issues

```text
The mobile menu isn't working properly. When I click the 
hamburger icon, nothing happens. Please fix the mobile 
navigation so it:
- Opens a slide-in menu from the right
- Shows all navigation links
- Includes a close button
- Closes when clicking outside the menu
```

### Styling changes

```text
Update the color scheme:
- Change primary color from blue to purple (#8B5CF6)
- Update all buttons to use the new primary color
- Adjust hover states to be slightly darker
- Update the hero gradient to use purple tones
- Keep everything else the same
```

## Advanced techniques

### Iterative refinement

Start broad, then refine:

1. "Create a features section"
2. "Make the features grid 4 columns instead of 3"
3. "Add icons to each feature"
4. "Increase spacing between features"
5. "Add a subtle hover effect"

### Conditional requests

Provide options:

```text
Create a pricing section. If possible, add:
- Annual/monthly toggle
- Feature comparison tooltip
- "Most popular" badge on middle tier

If those are too complex, start with a simple 3-tier layout.
```

### Reference previous work

Build on what exists:

```text
Using the same design style as the hero section, create 
a CTA section with:
- Compelling headline
- Short description
- Single prominent button
- Background color that complements the hero
```

## Plan mode

### When to use plan mode

Use plan mode for:

- Complex multi-page websites
- Projects with many features
- When you want to review before building
- Large scope projects

### Effective planning prompts

```text
I want to build a complete website for a restaurant.

Pages needed:
- Home (hero, about, menu preview, reservations CTA)
- Menu (categorized menu items with prices and descriptions)
- About (story, team, photos)
- Contact (form, map, hours, phone)

Features:
- Online reservation system
- Menu filtering by category
- Photo gallery
- Contact form with validation

Design: Warm, inviting, food-focused
Colors: Earth tones (browns, oranges, greens)

Please create a detailed plan before building.
```

## Discussion mode

### Brainstorming

Use discussion mode to explore ideas:

```text
I want to create a website for my photography business. 
I'm not sure what sections to include or how to structure it. 
Can you suggest some options and help me decide?
```

### Getting recommendations

```text
What's the best way to showcase a portfolio of 50+ projects? 
Should I use a grid, a carousel, or something else? 
What are the pros and cons of each approach?
```

### Clarifying requirements

```text
I need a contact form, but I'm not sure what fields to include. 
What's standard for a B2B service business? Should I ask for 
company size, budget, timeline?
```

## Common mistakes

### Too vague

❌ "Make it look better"
✅ "Increase font size of headings, add more spacing between sections, and use a lighter background color"

### Too many changes at once

❌ "Change colors, add animations, restructure the layout, add new sections, and update all the content"
✅ Make one change at a time, test, then move to the next

### Assuming context

❌ "Add the usual sections"
✅ "Add these sections: features, testimonials, pricing, FAQ"

### Not providing content

❌ "Create an about page"
✅ "Create an about page with this content: [paste content]"

## Tips for success

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with structure">
    Define the overall structure before diving into details. This helps AI understand the big picture.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Use consistent terminology">
    Stick to the same terms throughout your conversation. Don't switch between "hero section" and "banner."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Provide visual references">
    Link to websites or describe specific designs you like. "Make it like Apple's website" is clearer than "make it minimal."
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Test incrementally">
    Make changes, test them, then continue. Don't wait until the end to preview your website.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Be patient with complex requests">
    Large, complex websites take time. Break them into manageable pieces.
